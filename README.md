# Swapify-code
## Structure
For the front end of our project, we used HTML/CSS. For the back-end, we used a framework called Flask, which uses the Python programming language.

1. If Python has not been installed, this page will guide you in installing it. [a link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Make sure you have some type of software that supports HTML, CSS and Python. We decided to use VSCode.
